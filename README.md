# ARI EBD Dashboard

### Developed by: Nazimuddin Shaikh
### Advisor: Ibrahim Soumare

A dashboard developed for the Anti-Racist Institute for Teaching and Research @ St. Cloud State Univeristy (SCSU) to visualize course data and gather insights on how students of various demographics might be hindered in their course success.

I developed this dashboard while working as a Graduate Assistant at the Statistical Consulting and Research Center (SCRC) @ SCSU for the academic year 2023-2024.
