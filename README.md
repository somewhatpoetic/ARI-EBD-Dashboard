# ARI EBD Dashboard

### Developed by: Nazimuddin Shaikh
### Advisor: Ibrahim Soumare

A dashboard developed for the Anti-Racist Institute for Teaching and Research @ St. Cloud State Univeristy (SCSU) to visualize course data and gather insights on how students of various demographics might be hindered in their course success. 

The original idea was concieved and formalized by Dr. Ibrahim Soumare, and developed and implemented by Nazimuddin Shaikh.

This dashboard was developed while working as a Graduate Assistant at the Statistical Consulting and Research Center (SCRC) @ SCSU for the academic year 2023-2024.
